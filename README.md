# pdfGoogleAnalyticsLinkTracking
A set of scripts to extract hyperlinks in a PDF file and check for the presence of URL tracking tags, such as UTM parameters for Google Analytics

## Usage
Run `python pdf_workflow.py pdfname.pdf` from the command line.

## Requirements
Check requirements.txt for required modules (`pdfx`, `pdfminer`)

## Adaptations & TODO: 
- This script can easily be adapted to handle multiple PDF files
- Offer a web app version where PDF files can be uploaded and processed
- Adjust output, currently in list form but you can easily modify the script to suit your needs.
